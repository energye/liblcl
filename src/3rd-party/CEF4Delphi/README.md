# OldCEF4Delphi
OldCEF4Delphi is an open source project to embed Chromium-based browsers in applications made with Delphi.

OldCEF4Delphi is based on DCEF3, made by Henri Gourvest. The original license of DCEF3 still applies to OldCEF4Delphi. Read the license terms in the first lines of any *.pas file.

OldCEF4Delphi uses CEF 3.2623.1401.gb90a3be which includes Chromium 49.0.2623.110 and that means that it supports **Windows XP and Vista**. 
The CEF3 binaries used by OldCEF4Delphi are located in the "CEF3_binaries" directory.

OldCEF4Delphi was developed and tested on Delphi 10.4 and Delphi 7. It includes VCL and FireMonkey (FMX) components.

* These components use an old CEF library in order to support Windows XP and Vista. If you want the latest browser engine version and you only need to support Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 or newer then use [CEF4Delphi](https://github.com/salvadordf/CEF4Delphi)
* OldCEF4Delphi only supports Delphi. If you need Lazarus/FPC support use [CEF4Delphi](https://github.com/salvadordf/CEF4Delphi)
